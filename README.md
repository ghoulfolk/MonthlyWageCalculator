# MonthlyWageCalculator
Java-project I made at home that currently only reads 1 CSV-file (included in the project) but could be modified to include file uploading feature for other CSV-file compatibilities.
This project was made as a recruitment nut (showing personal capabilities and techniques used) for a software company.
This project uses WindowBuilder (Eclipse add-on) and OpenCSV-library.
